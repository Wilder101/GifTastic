# GifTastic
:octocat:
### Use of the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs.

**What the project does:**
This project is excellent for web developers to extend their knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, the jQuery library, Bootstrap, and the GIPHY API.

**Why the project is useful:**
GifTastic  is lightweight, client-side, and written in JavaScript & jQuery, with the exception of API calls to GIPHY, which require an Internet connection. It is useful for understanding how JavaScript-generated content can be created and for learning to use basic web API calls.

**How users can get started with the project:**
Clone and extend the project with a different user interface or easily create a different GifTastic application by changing the pre-set topics list to other categories of interest.

**Where users can get help with your project:**
One word here: "Google-fu." GifTastic is a common and interesting choice for budding web developers to practice being web developers. Also, https://developers.giphy.com/ has excellent documentation on how to use the GIPHY API.

**Who maintains and contributes to the project:**
As of November 11, 1018 -- Wilder Molyneux, sole author and contributor.
